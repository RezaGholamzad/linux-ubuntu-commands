1. Install VNC Server : 
1.1 System Update : 
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

+If there is an update, you should restart your server so that you can boot with the latest application : 
sudo reboot
***************************************
1.2 Install Tiger VNC : 
sudo apt install xserver-xorg-core
sudo apt install tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-xorg-extension tigervnc-viewer
***************************************
1.3 Install Gnome : 
sudo apt install ubuntu-gnome-desktop

+Start the gnome desktop service, and make sure it runs when booting : 
sudo systemctl start gdm
sudo systemctl enable gdm
***************************************
1.4 VNC Password Settings : 
+use the vncserver command, enter the password, then kill vncserver:
vncserver

+Enter your password, then verify. You can make the password read-only if needed. But if it’s not required, you can confirm by pressing the N button.
vncserver -kill :*

2.Startup Script Settings : 
nano ~/.vnc/xstartup

+ Next, we will create a startup script as the initial configuration that will be executed when the VNC Server is activated. Create a ~/.vnc/xstartup file with the nano command.
Then fill in the following code : 
#!/bin/sh 
[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
vncconfig -iconic &
dbus-launch --exit-with-session gnome-session &
**************************************
2.1 Start VNC Server : 
vncserver -localhost no -geometry 1360x768 -depth 24
+The above option will create a session that allows connections from outside with 800 × 600-pixel resolution and sharpness 24. You can configure the resolution and sharpness according to your taste.
**************************************
2.2 Start Stop Script :
+To make it easier, we will create a script to start the VNC server service. Also, with this script, we can make autostart VNC servers when the computer is turned on. Create a file with the name vncserver@.service in the /etc/systemd/system folder. Use the nano command : 
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@.service

+Then fill in the following script:
[Unit]
Description=VNC Server by TeknoTut
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=away

# Clean any existing files in /tmp/.X11-unix environment
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i > /dev/null 2>&1 || :
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vncserver -geometry 800x600 -depth 24 -localhost no :%i
ExecStop=/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

+Note that in the User row, make sure the user matches the user you are using. Because we use a user away, we fill the option away.(User = ubuntu)

+Stop all VNC sessions if available : 
vncserver -kill :*

+Make sure to enable at startup, then restart VNC Server :
sudo systemctl enable vncserver@1
sudo systemctl start vncserver@1

+Up to this point, your VNC Server has finished, and can automatically be used when your server is restarted.

3.Connect to VNC Server : 
+Well, after the installation process is complete, you can connect to the VNC Server by using the VNC Viewer that we have previously installed.
Enter your server’s IP address with port 5901 (For ID 1). If successful, you will be asked for a VNC password. Enter the VNC password that was previously set.

+For VNC clients from your computer. You can use the VNC Viewer application, for example, RealVNC. Please download the app and install it on your computer. 
You can get the RealVNC Viewer download page at VNC Viewer Download.
